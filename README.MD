# UPA Food Synthesizer

Welcome to the UPA Food Synthesizer, a futuristic culinary adventure inspired by the most innovative science fiction and the nostalgic charm of retro gadgets from the '90s. This project represents not just a leap into the world of tomorrow but also a nod to the past, blending the two into a unique digital experience.

## Inspiration

The UPA Food Synthesizer was conceived from a love for science fiction's imaginative tech and a deep appreciation for the quirky, often whimsical design of '90s gadgets. In envisioning this project, I sought to create a mock interface that not only pays homage to these eras but also pushes the boundary of what's possible in web design and interactivity.

## About the Project

The UPA Food Synthesizer is an interactive web application designed to simulate the experience of synthesizing your favorite meals with the click of a button. Drawing on the APIs from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) and [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/), along with a custom JSON file filled with detailed meal information, this project offers users a rich selection of dishes to explore and "synthesize".

### Features

- **Meal Selection**: Choose from a wide variety of meals sourced from TheMealDB API, each with its unique nutritional information and preparation details.
- **Interactive UI**: A user interface that captures the essence of '90s gadgetry while providing a modern, intuitive experience.
- **Mock Payment System**: Utilizing the ReqRes API, simulate the process of paying for your synthesized meal with futuristic UPA Credits.
- **Dynamic Content**: A custom JSON file supplements API data with additional meal information, enriching the user's exploration and selection process.

### Future Directions

The journey doesn't end here. The UPA Food Synthesizer is poised for further development, with plans to include:

- **Order History**: Track your synthesized meal selections and revisit your favorites at any time.
- **Food Customization**: Dive deeper into culinary creativity by customizing the ingredients and portions of your synthesized meals.
- **Expanded Selection**: Beyond meals, the next phase will introduce a variety of drinks to complement your dining experience.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensuring the UPA Food Synthesizer is accessible on a range of devices, offering a seamless experience from desktop to mobile.
